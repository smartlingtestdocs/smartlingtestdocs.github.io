<p>Smartling's File API allows you to upload and retrieve files, display a list of recently uploaded files, and check the status of a translationâ€™s progress. All URLs have the following base: https://api.smartling.com/v1</p>

<p>All the following calls require both the apiKey and projectID parameter, which you can find on at <a href="https://dashboard.smartling.com/settings/api">Project Settings>API</a> in the Smartling Dashboard.</p>

<p>Multiple READ operations can run simultaneously on a single file, but only one WRITE operation can run at a time. Attempting any other operation on a file while a WRITE operation is running will result in an error.</p>

<p>Concurrent API requests are limited to 20 per file and 50 per project. Exceeding this limit will result in a MAX_OPERATIONS_LIMIT_EXCEEDED error.</p>
