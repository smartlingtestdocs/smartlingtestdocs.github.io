<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Smartling Translation API is a REST-like API that allows you to access functionality provided by the Smartling Translation Management Platform using defined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure">HTTPS</a> requests and structured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json">JSON</a> responses. You can integrate translated content files into your application by simply uploading source content files, Smartling will handle the translations, and then you can download the translated files whenever it makes sense (most likely during deployment). You can always check the status of a file or get a list of files in translation.</p>

<p>To make things even easier, for several languages, Smartling has created <a href="/pages/SDKs/">SDKs</a>. This means you don't even need to worry about low-level API details. Just download our artifacts and integrate the API in your build process. Simple.</p>


<h3>Base URL</h3>
<p>All URLs within this documentation have the following base:</p>
<pre>https://api.smartling.com/v1</pre>


<h3>HTTP/HTTPS</h3>
<p>Smartling Translation API requests must be served over HTTPS. This ensures data privacy which is not provided by HTTP.</p>

<h3>Encoding</h3>
<p>File encoding is specified in the header for the content-type by specifying a charSet; for example:</p>
<pre>Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8 </pre>
<p>The Smartling Translation API supports UTF-8, UTF-16, US-ASCII, and ISO-8859-1 (aka Latin-1) encoding.</p>

<h3>Date Format</h3>
<p>All dates will follow the common <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601" rel="nofollow">ISO 8601</a> date and time standard format, and will be expressed in UTC:</p>
<p><code>YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss</code></p>
<p>For example, 10:31 PM UTC on Saturday, August 21, 2010 would be:</p>
<p><code>2010-08-21T22:31:00</code></p>

<h3>Authentication</h3>
<p>Every API request you make must include both an API key and projectId. These credentials must be kept secure and can be found in your Smartling dashboard at: https://dashboard.smartling.com/settings/api</p>
