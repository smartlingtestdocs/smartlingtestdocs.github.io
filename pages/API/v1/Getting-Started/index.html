    The Smartling Translation API provides file translation management for tasks that you can also accomplish using the Smartling dashboard. By helping to
    connect your application directly to Smartling's platform, the API makes it easier for you to access translations for a large number of files within a
    complex deployment environment. The Smartling Translation API is not a real-time translation service (like Google Translate) and given that humans need to
    complete the translations, there will be a delay as translators complete the work.

<h2>To get started with the Smartling Translation API:</h2>


<ol class="text-list">
    <li>
        Setup an account with Smartling, from: <a href="http://www.smartling.com/free-trial" rel="nofollow">http://www.smartling.com/free-trial</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Obtain an API key within your Smartling dashboard:
        <a href="https://dashboard.smartling.com/settings/api" rel="nofollow">
            https://dashboard.smartling.com/settings/api
            <br/>
            <img class="contentImage" src="settings_api.jpg"/>
            <br/>
        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Use the Smartling <a href="/pages/SDKs/" rel="nofollow">SDKs</a> to integrate translation of your resource files into
your development process by uploading modified resource files and downloading the latest during a release. Alternatively, you can use        <a href="/pages/Repository-Connector/" rel="nofollow">Smartling's Repository Connector</a> to integrate directly with
        your Github or Beanstalk repository, or use our <a href="/pages/Shell-Scripts" rel="nofollow">Bash scripts</a> to
        call the API directly from the terminal.
        <br/>
        At Smartling, on every commit we upload our Java properties files to the Smartling API and the translation workflow. During a release, our continuous
        deployment script retrieves and includes the translated files in the deployment artifact.
    </li>
    <li>
        Update your application code to recognize language-specific properties files, and add a language selector to your site.
    </li>

    Best Practices for Working with the Smartling Translation API
</h2>
<p>
    Here are some examples of how to work with the Smartling API to upload and download files in the Smartling Translation Management System (TMS).
</p>

<h4>Uploading localization files to the Smartling TMS</h4>

<h5>Example 1</h5>

<p>
Every time you check-in a localization file to your code repository, trigger a script to upload the file to the Smartling TMS via the API.
This approach makes the strings immediately available for translation. (You also have the option to manually approve this content for translation.)
Even if the source content changes, Smartling immediately collects those changes, and the Smartling Translation Memory ensures that the new content
leverages existing translations.
</p>


<h5>Example 2</h5>

<p>
        Write a script that you can run when deploying content to a staging server or through another dedicated build process that finds every localization
        file in your code repository and uploads them to the Smartling TMS via the API.
        This approach avoids translating non-final content but may slow the translation process as the content needs to be final before starting translations.
</p>


<h4>Downloading Localization Files from the TMS</h4>

<h5>Example 1</h5>
<p>
        Use the Smartling API <a href="/pages/API/FileAPI/#UploadFile">callbackUrl</a> parameter to
        have Smartling automatically notify you when all text strings in a localization file are 100% translated and published. You can also automate the
        downloading of the completed file for testing, deployment or other actions.
        This approach makes translations available immediately upon completion.
</p>


<h5>Example 2</h5>
<p>
        Run a script that calls the <a href="/pages/API/FileAPI/#List" rel="nofollow">file/list</a> API and
        returns the set of files (and their completeness) for a project. The script then reviews each file in the returned list and each locale in the project
        to download all files to your code repository.
        <br/>
        This approach makes completed translations available according to a scheduled or manual trigger and provides more control in the process for projects
        that involve significant web site changes or critical content.
</p>


<h5>Example 3</h5>
<p>Write a script to download the latest translations with each deployment of your code regardless of the state of the translations.

        This approach works well if you use continuous deployment and can live with original content appearing on your translated sites until translations are
        complete and deployed.
