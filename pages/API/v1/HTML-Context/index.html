<p>
    The HTML context API allows you to submit HTML for the purpose of providing context for your source content that will be shown in the Smartling Translation
    Interface. Smartling analyzes the HTML content you upload for context and matches strings in a Smartling project. When Smartling finds a match, the HTML
    you provided becomes the visual context that users see in the Smartling Translation Interface. Smartling will not create any new content from the HTML
    uploaded to the context matching service, and every unique string in Smartling can have only one context.
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    Smartling persistently stores the HTML you provide to this service. In order for context to look correct when it is used in the Smartling Translation
    Interface, the service attempts to “inline” static resources (CSS, JavaScript, images) if any are externally referenced from the HTML page you submitted.
    These resources need to be publicly available in order for Smartling to access them. If this is not possible, consider using the automation features of the
    <a href="http://support.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/202007178-Using-the-Smartling-Context-Capture-Extension-for-Chrome" rel="nofollow">
        Smartling Context Capture Extension for Chrome
    </a>
    to capture context.
</p>
<p>
    Smartling organizes content by URLs and URL context groups, and Files. The service will not change the context for strings that are already contextualized
unless you specifically use the override directive. This is functionally equivalent to using the Chrome Plugin and    <a href="http://support.smartling.com/hc/en-us/articles/202007178#overwrite" rel="nofollow">overwriting context by selecting specific strings</a>. Context
    groups are created automatically when you add context and use a URL that already has strings associated with it. Creating a new context group will not
    change strings that already have context with that URL. Strings that have no context before the call will appear in a separate group under the same URL.
</p>
<p>
    All API URLs have the following base: <a href="https://api.smartling.com/v1" rel="nofollow">https://api.smartling.com/v1</a>, and all of the following
calls require both the<strong> apiKey</strong> and<strong>projectId</strong> parameter which you can find within your Smartling project's dashboard:    <a href="https://dashboard.smartling.com/settings/api" rel="nofollow">https://dashboard.smartling.com/settings/api</a>
</p>
<p>
    Smartling supports string variants, which are duplications of the same string with different keys for context. You cannot specify which variant of a string
    you are contextualizing with the current version of this API.
