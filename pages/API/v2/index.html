<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The Smartling Translation API is a REST-like API that allows you to access functionality provided by the Smartling Translation Management Platform using defined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure">HTTPS</a> requests and structured <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json">JSON</a> responses. You can integrate translated content files into your application by simply uploading source content files, Smartling will handle the translations, and then you can download the translated files whenever it makes sense (most likely during deployment). You can always check the status of a file or get a list of files in translation.</p>
