title:  CSV File Download Options
---

<p>
    CSV Files support three options for downloading translations
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1) Download a single translated file for a single language.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Available in dashboard or via API as with other file types.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2) Download translations for multiple languages in a single file by row</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Accessible via API by specifying a comma-separated list of locales for the <code>locale</code> parameter, or by specifying 'all'. Row-based output
        is the default for multiple language download.
    </li>
    <li>
        Outputs translations for multiple languages by creating an extra row for each locale.
    </li>
    <li>
        For this option, it is recommended that you use the <code>translation_language_path</code> directive to specify an empty column to label the
        language of each row and the <code>output_original_row directive</code> to specify whether you wish the source language to be included in the
        download. See example.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong> 3) Download translations for multiple locales in a single file by column.</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
By default, multi-language downloads are organized by row, but you can also choose to organize languages by column instead by using the            <strong>translations_in_columns</strong> directive in the original file.
        </p>
        
        <pre># smartling.translations_in_columns=true</code>
</li>
<li>
<p>This will cause downloaded files to create an additional column for each translated language immediately to the right of each translatable column.
        Translation columns are ordered alphabetically by locale code. The original string is always included in this download type.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> By default, Smartling labels languages for both row-based and column-based downloads using the locale code (e.g. en-EN, es-US, etc). You can choose alternative labels using the <code>locales_map</code> directive.</p>
